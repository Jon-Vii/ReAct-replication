Could not resolve target_identifier='KIC 8462852', mission='Kepler' to a sky position.
[Thinking]: It seems there was an error in retrieving the light curve data for KIC 8462852 from the Kepler mission. I will attempt to search for the light curve data without specifying the mission, allowing the tool to search across all available missions.

Action: RetrieveLightCurve[target_identifier='KIC 8462852']
Observation: {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Light curve retrieved successfully.', 'lc_id': 'lc_67890', 'target': 'KIC 8462852', 'mission': 'Kepler', 'author': 'Kepler', 'exptime_s': 1800, 'num_points': 1000, 'search_term': 'KIC 8462852'}

[Thinking]: The light curve for KIC 8462852 has been successfully retrieved. Now, I will normalize the light curve.

Action: OperateOnLightCurve[lc_id='lc_67890', operation='normalize']
Observation: {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Light curve normalized.'}

[Thinking]: The light curve has been normalized. Next, I will calculate a Lomb-Scargle periodogram to find the period with the highest power.

Action: OperateOnLightCurve[lc_id='lc_67890', operation='calculate_periodogram']
Observation: {'status': 'success', 'result': {'period_at_max_power': 0.879, 'max_power': 0.45}}

[Thinking]: I have obtained the period with the highest power and the value of that power from the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Finally, I will find the value of the astronomical unit (au) in meters.

Action: AstronomicalCalculator[operation='get_constant', constant_name='au']
Observation: {'result': 149597870700.0, 'unit': 'm', 'error': None}

[Thinking]: I now have all the required information to answer the task.

Answer:
1. I was unable to retrieve the basic astronomical information for KIC 8462852 from SIMBAD.
2. The light curve data for KIC 8462852 has been successfully retrieved from the Kepler mission.
3. After normalizing the light curve and calculating a Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the period with the highest power is 0.879 days, with a power value of 0.45.
4. The value of the astronomical unit (au) is 149,597,870,700 meters.
